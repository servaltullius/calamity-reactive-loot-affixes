# DONT_DO_THIS (vibe-kit)

Avoid these by default:
- Repo-wide formatting/re-linting.
- Large “cleanup” refactors unrelated to the task.
- Editing generated artifacts or sample outputs unless explicitly needed (e.g. `dist/`, `build/`, fixtures).
- Changing placeholder/token rules without updating tests.
